Nothing much has changed. We still have a _lot_ of work to do and the feedback received does add to the list of things to get right. However, it does mean that we could probably start sharing the links to a slightly larger group, making the circle a tiny bit bigger. The feedback loop is ever important.

I addition, it does pave the way for _"o, hell, people could actually see this"_, so does put on some extra pressure. I guess the age-old rule of _"if you are 100% happy with your product, you launched too late"_ applies here. Although, this is not quite a launch.
